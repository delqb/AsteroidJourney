/** 
 * This function implements the **Separating Axis Theorem** (SAT) to detect collisions between two convex polygons.
 * 
 * Edge vectors are computed from each polygon's vertices. Then, their unit normal vectors are calculated and used as potential separating axes.
 * Each polygon is projected onto these axes, and the minimum and maximum values of their projections are checked for overlap.
 * - If projections on any axis do not overlap, the function exits early and returns `true`, indicating a separating axis exists.
 * - If all axes are tested without finding a separating axis, the function returns `false`, meaning the polygons are intersecting.
 * 
 * This function also computes the dot product between each polygon's unit normal and a fixed reference axis (`reference_axis`).
 * The dot product is then quantized to a level of precision determined by the `quantization_precision` parameter, and the result is cached in a set.
 * The caching mechanism helps avoid redundant checks for axes that have already been tested, optimizing performance.
 * 
 * @param polygonA A 'ConvexPolygon' array of vectors, ordered either counter-clockwise or clockwise.
 * @param polygonB A 'ConvexPolygon' array of vectors, ordered either counter-clockwise or clockwise.
 * @param quantization_precision The precision used to quantize the dot product between each polygon's unit normal and the reference axis.
 *                             A higher value (e.g., 1e6) results in finer precision, while a lower value reduces precision and can 
 *                             improve performance by skipping projection checks for nearly identical axes. This parameter optimizes 
 *                             the algorithm by caching previously tested axes.
 * 
 * @returns `true` if a separating axis is found, indicating no overlap between the polygons.
 *          `false` if no separating axis is found, indicating the polygons intersect.
