/**
 * Performs a conservative rasterization of an oriented bounding box (OBB) over a grid.
 *
 * Samples points across the interior of the OBB and maps them to grid cell indices,
 * invoking a callback for each unique cell intersected. Projection factors extend
 * the rasterized area to mitigate undercoverage.
 * 
 * This function is accurately represented in the following Desmos graph:
 * https://www.desmos.com/calculator/f4o93uvlpc
 * The graph offers an interactive visualization of the OBB, projected dimensions, axes, and cell index computations.
 * It highlights selected grid cells and exposes intermediate values to support intuitive understanding and precise parameter tuning.
 *
 * @param rectWidth Width of the OBB (in world units).
 * @param rectHeight Height of the OBB (in world units).
 * @param cellSize Size of each grid cell.
 * @param widthProjectionFactor Scalar multiplier to widen the OBB along its local width axis.
 * @param heightProjectionFactor Scalar multiplier to widen the OBB along its local height axis.
 * @param axes The local orientation vectors (x and y) of the OBB.
 * @param center The center position of the OBB in world space.
 * @param scanResolution Scalar factor that modulates the number of sampling steps per axis; higher values result in finer subdivisions and improved coverage accuracy at increased computational cost.
 * @param collect Callback invoked with each (i, j) grid cell index covered by the OBB.
